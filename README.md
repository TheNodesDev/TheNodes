[dependencies]
thenodes = "0.1.0"
```

This guide targets version 0.1.0.

## What Is TheNodes?

TheNodes is a modular, async-first peer-to-peer (P2P) node framework. It supplies the plumbing—network transport, peer discovery, identity, trust / optional TLS, realms (isolation domains), event instrumentation, and a dynamic plugin system—so you can focus on application logic packaged as plugins.

### Core Value Proposition
- Reuse a battle-tested networking + trust substrate instead of re‑inventing sockets, identity, and message routing.
- Isolate your domain code into loadable plugins for easier upgrades, selective deployment, and cleaner boundaries.
- Optionally host multiple distinct realms (each a discrete, durable network) side‑by‑side with one binary for development, testing, or specialized gateway nodes. (In normal production operation a node process commits to a single realm for its lifetime; a realm name is analogous to a public network identity like a "mainnet" label and is not something nodes hop between.)
- Gain structured events (JSONL) for auditing, metrics, and security introspection.

### Integration Models
1. NEP (Node-Embedded Plugins) – Run the provided host binary; it loads plugins from a directory.
2. CAL (Core-as-a-Library) – Embed the library in your own binary and drive the lifecycle yourself.

Daemon deployment is simply NEP mode operated headlessly under a supervisor (systemd, Docker, Kubernetes). No separate “service mode” is required.

### Intended Use Cases
- Robust distributed coordination or messaging fabrics requiring clear isolation boundaries (realms) and auditability.
- Edge / IoT overlay networks where safety, controlled trust establishment, and incremental rollout matter.
- Secure multi-tenant or multi-environment deployments (prod vs staging vs lab) sharing the same binary but strictly partitioned.
- Extensible application networks where operators plug in domain logic (KV, metrics, workflow, policy) without touching core.
- Evolution of new or existing P2P protocol features with guard rails (add variants/plugins while keeping core stable).

### Non-Goals (Current)
- Bundled consensus / blockchain implementation (can be layered via plugins if desired).
- Turnkey distributed storage/database semantics (state management kept minimal on purpose).
- Built-in certificate issuance / ACME automation (external PKI tooling assumed; we focus on consumption & policy).
- Heavy RPC surface (intentionally remains a lean messaging core—higher abstractions belong in plugins).

### When To Choose TheNodes
Choose TheNodes when you need a security-conscious, extensible P2P node foundation with:
1. Clear separation between infrastructure (core) and application logic (plugins).
2. Realm-based isolation for environments / tenants.
3. Optional but structured trust & encryption controls (TLS + policy) without locking you into one PKI workflow.
4. An async-first Rust implementation emphasizing memory safety and predictable performance.

If your requirement is only basic request/response between a few services, a simpler HTTP/QUIC stack may suffice. If you aim to grow a multi-feature overlay where safety, controlled evolution, and auditability matter, TheNodes fits.

### Implementation Language & Portability
This reference implementation is written in Rust to leverage strong compile-time guarantees, memory safety without GC, and an async ecosystem (Tokio) well-suited for high concurrency. Other implementations (different languages or specialized runtime targets) are welcome and encouraged; the architectural concepts—realms, message types, plugin-driven extension—are intentionally portable.

### High-Level Architecture
```

```

### Design Principles
- Async-first (non-blocking everywhere it matters).
- Least surprise: user config always overrides plugin defaults.
- Additive extensibility: new message variants and config keys shouldn’t break existing deployments.
- Observability: structured, typed events over ad-hoc printlns.

## Key Concepts

- **Node-Embedded Plugins (NEP):** Main binary hosts plugins for app logic.
- **Core-as-a-Library (CAL):** Node logic as a reusable library.
- **Realms:** Logical isolation domains; nodes must share a realm (and optionally version/capabilities) to fully interact.

## Distribution Model (Both Modes)

**Important:** Both NEP and CAL modes use TheNodes as **compiled/distributed code**, not source code in your project directory.

**NEP Mode:**
```
my-app/
├── thenodes              # Pre-built binary (downloaded/installed)  
├── plugins/
│   └── libmydomain.so    # Your compiled plugin (.so/.dylib/.dll)
├── config/
│   └── app.toml
└── my-plugin-src/        # Separate plugin development project
    ├── Cargo.toml        # Depends on thenodes = "0.1.0" for Plugin trait
    └── src/lib.rs        # Your plugin code
```

**CAL Mode:**
```
my-app/
├── Cargo.toml            # Lists thenodes = "0.1.0" as dependency
├── src/
│   └── main.rs           # Your app using TheNodes APIs  
└── config/
    └── app.toml
```

**Key Point:** You **do not** need TheNodes source code in either mode. TheNodes is distributed as:
- **NEP:** Pre-compiled binary + library for plugin development
- **CAL:** Library crate dependency (like tokio, serde, etc.)

The only exception is if you want to modify TheNodes core itself (contributions) or build from source instead of using releases.

## Where Your Application Logic Belongs

If you are adopting TheNodes primarily for its networking, discovery, realms, and trust layers, put **all domain / business logic in one or more plugins**, not in the core `src/` tree. Reasons:

- Separation of Concerns: Core stays focused on transport, identity, trust, and protocol primitives.
- Upgrade Flexibility: You can update TheNodes independently of your app code.
- Deployment Modularity: Enable/disable features by choosing which plugin libraries (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`) to ship.
- Testability: Plugins can be unit/integration tested in isolation using only the stable-intent API (see `prelude`).

Recommended layout for an application using NEP mode:
```
my-app/
  thenodes/              # git submodule or dependency
  plugins/
  libmydomain.so       # core domain logic (use appropriate extension)
  libmetrics.so        # metrics / observability extension
  libworkflow.so       # higher-level orchestration
  config/
    app.toml
```

When to modify core instead:
- You are contributing generic capabilities (e.g., a new transport) beneficial to all users.
- You are extending message schema in a reusable way (new `MessageType` variant with broad applicability).

CAL Mode Note: When embedding as a library, you *may* still internally structure logic like plugins (using the trait) or directly call APIs; prefer the plugin boundary if you foresee later moving to NEP runtime loading.

## Build & Run

- **Build as library (CAL):**
  ```sh
  cargo build --release --lib
  ```
- **Build standalone NEP host:**
  ```sh
  cargo build --release
  ```
- **Run with config:**
  ```sh
  cargo run --bin thenodes -- --config config/myconfig.toml
  ```
- **Prompt mode:**
  ```sh
  cargo run --bin thenodes -- --config config/myconfig.toml --prompt
  ```
  In prompt mode you can type `version` (or `about`) to display the running application version, protocol version, git commit (if embedded), and build timestamp.

## Security

Security by design and secure by default.

- Production templates and examples enable TLS by default and recommend mTLS with a restrictive trust policy (allowlist/pins) for production.
- Development remains configurable; you may explicitly set `encryption.enabled = false` for local testing.
- Read the full guidance and PKI layout in `docs/SECURITY.md`.

### TLS & Trust Policy (Overview)
TheNodes supports optional TLS. When disabled, traffic is plaintext (development / controlled environments). When TLS is enabled, the `[encryption.trust_policy]` `mode` controls how peer certificates are evaluated. The currently implemented modes behave as follows:

- `open` – accept any presented certificate (while still applying pinning and validity flags if configured). Useful for quick internal experiments. When `store_new_certs = "observed"`, first-seen certs are copied into the observed directory.
- `allowlist` – only accept certificates whose SPKI fingerprint already exists in `pki/trusted/certs`. New fingerprints are rejected and therefore never written to `observed/`, even if `store_new_certs` is set.
- `observe` – always reject untrusted certificates but still write their fingerprints to `pki/observed/certs` (or the configured directory). Useful for staged rollouts that want visibility before promoting certs.
- `tofu` – "Trust On First Use": accept a previously unseen fingerprint once, record it (if `observed_dir` is configured), and require the same fingerprint on subsequent connections. Handy for bootstrapping a trust store.
- `hybrid` (placeholder) – currently identical to `open` but tagged in logs so future staged enforcement can be layered on without config churn.

> The planned `ca` mode (full CA validation) is reserved for a future release.

Phased trust policy work adds layered security features without breaking existing configurations.

Phase 2 (current baseline) adds:
- SPKI fingerprint (SHA-256) via ASN.1 parsing (fallback to DER hash only on parse failure).
- Heuristic chain analysis (self-signed vs issuer-present) with explanatory `chain_reason`.
- Flags: `enforce_ca_chain`, `reject_expired`, `reject_before_valid` (time parsing placeholder; currently reports `unparsed`).
- Expanded logging fields: `chain_valid`, `chain_reason`, `time_valid`, `time_reason`.

Phase 3 (pinning core delivered) adds:
- Pin sets: `pin_fingerprints` (exact SPKI SHA-256 hex) and `pin_subjects` (exact or `~substring`).
- Realm binding: `realm_subject_binding` ensures the active realm name appears in certificate subject (if enabled).
- Enforcement ordering: fingerprint pins -> subject pins -> realm binding -> chain/time flags -> mode logic.
- Promotion helper: move observed certs into trusted directory programmatically (`promote_observed_to_trusted`).

`store_new_certs` only has an effect in modes that actually admit or capture new fingerprints (`open`, `observe`, `tofu`, `hybrid`). Allowlist deployments should populate `pki/trusted/certs` out-of-band or via promotion tooling.

Example trust policy snippet with pinning:
```toml
[encryption.trust_policy]
mode = "allowlist"              # or open | observe | tofu
pin_fingerprints = ["a1b2c3...deadbeef"]
pin_subjects = ["~MyOrg-Nodes", "CN=Node-Primary"]
realm_subject_binding = true
store_new_certs = "observed"     # still useful for TOFU discovery if mode=tofu
accept_self_signed = true         # still honored for self-signed deployments
```

Operational notes:
- Populate pin lists after an initial observation period (e.g., run in TOFU mode, harvest fingerprints from logs / observed dir filenames).
- Certificate rotations require updating pins first to avoid availability loss.
- If any subject-based constraint (pins or realm binding) is active and the subject cannot be parsed, the connection is currently rejected (future soft-fail option planned).

Roadmap (selected upcoming): full CA path validation, real time validity enforcement, `ca` / `hybrid` modes, JSON audit logs, CRL/OCSP integration, hot reloadable pin sets, CLI utilities for promotion & pin generation.

See `SECURITY_TRUST_POLICY_PLAN.md` for detailed status.

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)
Mutual TLS can be enabled to authenticate BOTH sides of a connection. Set `mtls = true` in the `[encryption]` section.

Minimal config example:
```toml
[encryption]
enabled = true
mtls = true                # require and present client certs

  [encryption.paths]
  own_certificate  = "pki/own/cert.pem"
  own_private_key  = "pki/own/key.pem"
  trusted_cert_dir = "pki/trusted/certs"   # used as root store for client cert verification

  [encryption.trust_policy]
  mode = "allowlist"       # open | observe | allowlist | tofu | hybrid (hybrid placeholder)
  store_new_certs = "observed"  # (optional for tofu mode)

  [encryption.trust_policy.paths]
  observed_dir = "pki/observed/certs"
```

Behavior summary:
- mtls=false (default): Only server cert is presented; client identity at TLS layer is unauthenticated.
- mtls=true: Client presents its certificate; server requires and evaluates it using trust policy.
- allowlist mode + mtls=true: Only peers with certs in `trusted_cert_dir` are accepted.
- tofu mode + mtls=true: First-seen certs can be recorded to `observed_dir` (if configured) for future continuity checks.

Operational tips:
- Ensure `own_certificate` / `own_private_key` exist before enabling mTLS.
- Populate `trusted_cert_dir` before switching to `allowlist` + mTLS or connections will be rejected.
- Missing client cert (on outbound) logs a warning and falls back to one-way TLS; inbound without a cert is rejected when mTLS is enabled.

Future phases will add CA / hybrid chain validation and pinning without changing the `mtls` flag semantics.

### Logging / Events Configuration
Add an optional `[logging]` section to control event sinks:
```toml
[logging]
json_path = "logs/custom_audit.jsonl"  # JSON lines audit file (rotated)
json_max_bytes = 10485760               # 10 MB before rotation (default 5 MB)
json_rotate = 5                         # keep 5 rotated files (default 3)
disable_console = false                 # set true to disable console sink
```
If `[logging]` is omitted, defaults are applied (`logs/trust_audit.jsonl`, 5MB, 3 rotations, console enabled).

### Node Identity Configuration
Add an optional `[node]` section to configure how a node ID is determined. Order of precedence:
1. Explicit `id` in config.
2. Persisted ID file inside `state_dir` (created if absent).
3. Generated UUID v4 (persisted) if file missing.
4. Ephemeral UUID (only if `allow_ephemeral = true`).

Config example:
```toml
[node]
state_dir = "data/nodeA"   # directory where runtime state (node_id file) is stored
id_file = "node_id"         # filename inside state_dir
# id = "my-static-node"     # uncomment to force a fixed id
allow_ephemeral = true       # if persistence fails, allow an in-memory id
```

On first run (no `id` and no existing file), a UUID is generated and written atomically to `data/nodeA/node_id`.
On subsequent runs the same ID is reused. A `SystemEvent` with action `identity_resolved` is emitted containing the chosen id.

Validation: IDs must be <=128 chars and contain only `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. Invalid configured IDs trigger a warning and fallback to generation.

Operational tip: Run multiple nodes on the same machine by giving each a distinct `state_dir`.

### Node types and realm access
Some realms may define roles like "daemon", "admin", or custom labels. TheNodes carries an optional node type in the HELLO handshake and can enforce an allow-list per realm.

Config keys:
```toml
[node]
node_type = "daemon" # optional; free-form string defined by your realm/protocol

[realm_access]
allowed_node_types = ["daemon", "admin"] # if set, only these remote types are accepted
```

Notes:
- If `realm_access.allowed_node_types` is omitted, all remote types are allowed.
- If it is set, peers that don't advertise a node type or advertise a non-allowed type are rejected at handshake.
- This is realm-defined policy: choose labels and enforcement aligned with your protocol.

### Event System & Promotion Events

TheNodes uses an asynchronous event pipeline (see `src/events/`) instead of ad-hoc logging. Core domains emit structured events (`TrustDecisionEvent`, `PromotionEvent`, `NetworkEvent`, `PluginEvent`, `SystemEvent`) which are broadcast to registered sinks (console, rotating JSON file, or plugin-defined sinks).

Components:
- `EventDispatcher` – global async fan-out loop.
- `EventHandle` – lightweight clone for emitting events or registering sinks (exposed to plugins).
- Sinks – implement `LogSink` with an async `handle(&self, event: &LogEvent)` method.

`PromotionEvent` is emitted when an observed certificate is promoted to the trusted store via `promote_observed_to_trusted`, providing an immutable audit record of trust-state changes distinct from per-connection `TrustDecisionEvent`s.

Current PromotionEvent fields:
- `fingerprint` (SPKI SHA-256 hex)
- `from_store` / `to_store` (paths)
- `operator` (origin, e.g. `runtime` now; future: `cli`, `api`)
- `success`
- Embedded `meta` (timestamp, session id, level, optional policy checksum)

Example JSON (abridged):
```jsonc
{ "type": "promotion", "fingerprint": "d4b7...ce42", "from_store": "pki/observed/certs/d4b7...ce42.pem", "to_store": "pki/trusted/certs/d4b7...ce42.pem", "operator": "runtime", "success": true }
```

#### Plugin: Registering a Custom Sink
Plugins can capture events (for metrics, forwarding, alerting) by registering a sink during initialization.

Minimal sink pattern:
```rust
use thenodes::events::{sink::LogSink, model::LogEvent};
use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::sync::Arc;

struct MetricsSink;

#[async_trait]
impl LogSink for MetricsSink {
  async fn handle(&self, event: &LogEvent) {
    if let LogEvent::Promotion(p) = event {
      // increment metrics registry, etc.
    }
  }
}

fn register(ctx: &mut PluginContext) {
  ctx.events().register_sink(Arc::new(MetricsSink));
}
```

Emitting a plugin-defined event:
```rust
use thenodes::events::{dispatcher, model::{LogEvent, SystemEvent, LogLevel}};
let meta = dispatcher::meta("plugin.example", LogLevel::Info);
ctx.events().emit(LogEvent::System(SystemEvent { meta, action: "started".into(), detail: None }));
```

Roadmap additions: policy checksum embedding, metrics sink example crate, CLI-driven promotion with explicit operator tagging, richer trust audit tooling.

## Realms
Realms create *overlay boundaries* so multiple independent networks can coexist using the same binary and plugin set.

### Realm = Durable Network Identity
Think of a realm name as the identity of an entire logical network. A node instance normally belongs to exactly **one** realm for its lifecycle. You do **not** routinely point the same long‑running node at different realms day‑to‑day; instead you run separate processes (or deployments) for each realm you operate. The `version` field exists to coordinate protocol evolution *within* a realm without renaming it. Multi‑realm hosting in a single binary is provided mainly for:
- Local development / integration testing.
- Specialized gateway or bridging tooling (future) that must observe or translate between realms.
- Operational convenience when spinning up ephemeral test realms.

Production guidance: pick a concise, stable realm name early (e.g., `prod-messaging`), evolve semantics via capabilities and version numbers, and avoid churn in the name itself. If you truly need a clean‑slate incompatible environment with different trust roots or business purpose, create a **new** realm name and deploy a separate set of node processes.

### Components
- Name / ID (primary discriminator)
- Version (coordinate breaking protocol evolution)
- Capabilities (future optional feature negotiation)
- Handshake validation logic

### Example Realm Catalog
| Realm              | Purpose                                 | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| `my-chat-protocol` | Custom chat app network                 |       |
| `my-sync`          | Custom network to sync servers          |       |
| `prod-messaging`   | Production messaging fabric             | Strict allowlist trust policy |
| `staging-messaging`| Pre-production soak tests               | TOFU accepted initially |
| `sensor-mesh`      | IoT sensor aggregation overlay          | Constrained capabilities |
| `metrics-grid`     | Telemetry distribution layer            | Candidate for QUIC |

### Config Snippet
```toml
[realm]
name = "prod-messaging"
version = "1"
# capabilities = ["kv", "metrics"]  # optional / future
```

### Multi-Realm Deployment
Run a separate process (or systemd template instance) per realm with distinct config, state directory, and (if TLS) PKI material. Pin binary versions per realm if they diverge.

### Upgrade Strategy
1. Add capabilities additively where possible.
2. Deploy dual-compatible version across realm.
3. Bump `version` only when removing or changing semantics.

### Naming Guidelines
- Include environment + purpose (`prod-`, `stage-`).
- Keep short (<32 chars) and DNS-safe (`[a-z0-9-]`).
- Avoid secrets / internal ticket numbers.

### Troubleshooting Realm Mismatch
Symptom: Disconnect shortly after handshake; event log may show a mismatch. Checklist:
1. Compare `[realm].name`.
2. Check `version` alignment.
3. Ensure required capabilities overlap.
4. Confirm correct config file loaded by process.

See `src/realms/realm.rs` for validation logic.

## Example Plugin Workflow

1. **Build the plugin:**
   ```sh
   cd examples/kvstore_plugin
   cargo build --release
   ```
2. **Copy the compiled `.so` to the plugin directory:**
   ```sh
   cp target/release/libkvstore_plugin.so ../../plugins/
   ```
3. **Run TheNodes:**
   ```sh
   cd ../../
   cargo run -- --config config.toml
   ```
   The plugin loader will load all plugins from the `plugins/` directory at runtime.

### Plugin ABI Basics

Plugins are compiled as dynamic libraries that expose a single registration symbol with a C-friendly signature. TheNodes now provides a stable function-table ABI so plugin crates do not rely on Rust-specific calling conventions across the FFI boundary.

- The host exports `thenodes::plugin_host::PluginRegistrarApi` and `PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION`. Plugins receive a raw pointer to this struct when they are loaded.
- The struct contains only FFI-safe fields (version, opaque context pointer, function pointers). Helper methods convert it into the familiar `PluginRegistrar` behavior inside the host.
- Use the safe helper `PluginRegistrarApi::register_plugin` to hand the plugin implementation back to the host. The helper performs ABI version checking and reports any mismatch.

Minimal registration pattern inside a plugin crate:

```rust
use thenodes::plugin_host::{Plugin, PluginContext, PluginRegistrarApi};

#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn register_plugin(api: *const PluginRegistrarApi) {
  let api = match PluginRegistrarApi::from_raw(api) {
    Ok(api) => api,
    Err(err) => {
      eprintln!("[example_plugin] invalid registrar API: {err}");
      return;

`PluginRegistrarApi::register_plugin` will return an error if the host and plugin were built against different `PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION` values, making version skew easy to detect during load. Because the ABI is now C-compatible, plugins can be authored in other languages (or with different Rust toolchains) as long as they construct the same function table.
