# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in TheNodes, please report it responsibly.

- Reporting: Email security@thenodes.dev (or open a private security advisory if enabled).
- Supported Versions: Prior to 1.0.0, the most recent minor series (0.x) will receive security fixes. After 1.0.0, supported versions will be listed in this document.
- Disclosure: We aim to acknowledge reports promptly (best effort, typically within a few days) and will share remediation plans as soon as practical given project resources and issue severity.

For the full security and trust policy, including PKI layout, TLS configuration, and trust models, see:

- docs/SECURITY.md (detailed policy and rationale)
- docs/SECURITY_TRUST_POLICY_PLAN.md (design notes and roadmap)

Thank you for helping keep TheNodes secure.
