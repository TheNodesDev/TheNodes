# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once the first public release is cut.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Templates (production/hybrid-app): align to current public APIs so newly scaffolded apps build cleanly.
	- listener: add the new `emit_console_errors: bool` argument to `start_listener(…)`.
	- bootstrap: pass `allow_console` based on prompt mode (`!args.prompt`).
	- prompt: update to `run_prompt_mode(plugin_manager, config)` two-argument signature.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- Core async-first P2P framework with plugin host, supporting both NEP (Node-Embedded Plugins) and CAL (Core-as-a-Library) modes.
- Networking components: peer manager, listener, protocol, with dynamic peer discovery (PeerRequest/PeerList) gated by config.
- Realm abstraction for logical network segmentation and compatibility.
- Optional TLS (rustls) with trust policy modes: open, allowlist, observe, and TOFU; mTLS flag.
- Pin-based trust controls: subject/fingerprint pinning and realm-subject binding.
- Trust promotion helper and prompt commands (e.g., `trust observed list`, `trust promote <fingerprint>`).
- Background reconnect after promotion to apply trust changes without manual intervention.
- Event system with structured System/Trust events and JSONL audit sink.
- Plugin-supplied configuration defaults (including `bootstrap_nodes_extend` append semantics).
- Example plugins and apps: `examples/kvstore_plugin` and `examples/simple_node.rs`.
- Template scaffolding hardened to avoid IDE/indexing noise: manifests use `Cargo.toml.template` and Rust sources `*.rs.tmpl`, restored by the generator when scaffolding projects.
- Strict ASCII kebab-case transliteration utility: Latin-only transliteration with `ü/Ü → ue`, non‑Latin treated as separators, and collapsed/truncated separators.

### Docs
- Plugin authoring guide updated to current APIs (MSRV 1.74, crate-type under `[lib]`, prompt usage, async-trait note).
- Security/trust plan updated to reflect current status: Phase 1 complete; Phase 2 scaffolding (chain/time); Phase 3 pinning & promotion delivered; audit logging available.

### Build
- Tooling: added `rust-toolchain.toml` (MSRV 1.74).
- CI: relaxed Clippy policy (deny correctness/perf; warn style/complexity), formatting check, and full workspace build/test.

### Security
- Trust policy enhancements and auditability: pinning, realm binding, promotion UX, and structured JSONL trust audit sink.
